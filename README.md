## usage

```js

yarn add oxinion

import {getDistance} from 'oxinion'

const midPoint = getDistance([51.5074, 0.1278], [51.5074, 0.1278], 'kilometers')
console.log(`Distance : ${midPoint} km`)

```

## Dynamic Communication Method Configuration

1. Using HTTP and REST API
   API Integration: Use HTTP requests (REST APIs) to interact with location-based services for geocoding, routing, and POI search functionalities.

```js
// Set communication method HTTP
oxinion.setCommunicationMethod("rest");
```

2. Using WebSockets (socket.io)
   Real-Time Updates: Implement WebRTC or WebSockets (socket.io) for real-time location sharing or notifications in collaborative mapping or geofencing scenarios.

```js
import oxinion from "oxinion";

oxinion.listenForLocationUpdates((data) => {
  console.log("Received location update:", data);
});
```

3. Using Webhooks
   Event-Driven: Utilize Webhooks for receiving location updates or triggering actions based on geofencing events.

```js
oxinion
  .triggerLocationUpdateWebhook({ lat: 51.5074, lon: 0.1278 })
  .then((response) => {
    console.log("Webhook triggered successfully:", response);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Error triggering webhook:", error);
  });
```

## Additional Features for oxinion Library

### 1. Multiple API Providers Support:

- Allow developers to configure and switch between different geocoding or mapping service providers (e.g., Google Maps, Mapbox, OpenStreetMap) dynamically.

- Example: Implement methods for geocoding, reverse geocoding, and routing that support different APIs based on developer configuration.

### 2. Location-based Notifications:

- Enable developers to set up geofences and trigger notifications when users enter or exit specific geographic areas.

- Example: Implement methods to register geofences and handle notifications using Webhooks or WebSocket for real-time updates.

### 3. Offline Support and Caching:

- Provide mechanisms to cache location data for offline access and synchronize data when connectivity is restored.
- Example: Implement methods to store and retrieve cached location data using local storage or IndexedDB in browsers.

Location Analytics and Reporting:

Support analytics features such as tracking user movements, generating heatmaps, or analyzing location-based trends over time.
Example: Implement methods to collect and analyze location data, providing insights through visualizations or reports.
Integration with IoT Devices:

Facilitate communication with IoT devices equipped with location sensors (e.g., GPS, Bluetooth) to gather real-time location data.
Example: Implement methods to interface with IoT protocols (MQTT, CoAP) for device-to-cloud communication and geolocation.
Real-time Collaboration and Mapping:

Enable collaborative mapping features where multiple users can view and interact with shared maps in real-time.
Example: Implement WebSocket-based methods for sharing live location updates between users on a map interface.
Customizable Event Handlers:

Allow developers to define custom event handlers for specific location-based events (e.g., user movement, proximity alerts).
Example: Implement methods to register callbacks or listeners for custom events triggered by location changes or user actions.
Location-based Authentication and Authorization:

Integrate location data into authentication workflows, such as verifying user locations for access control or secure transactions.
Example: Implement methods to validate user locations based on predefined criteria or geofencing rules.
